            From pecan pralines to ‘dots’ as currency: how the prison economy

            When economic freedoms are taken away, informal markets will always
            find new and ingenious ways to satisfy demand.

            When Wilbert Rideau was 19, in 1961, he killed a man in a bungled
            bank robbery. After being convicted and sentenced to death, he was
            sent to Louisiana State Penitentiary, known by prisoners, guards and
            locals as Angola after a slave plantation that previously existed on
            the site. Rideau was given the label C-18. The C stood for
            “condemned”, and the number denoted his place on the death-row list.
            His fate was to be the electric chair.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rideau lived in isolation on death row for more than a decade, and
            read voraciously. He became interested in journalism and started to
            write. By the mid-1970s he was living in the main prison and editing
            the penitentiary’s in-house monthly magazine, the Angolite. In the
            end Rideau avoided execution, and today he is undoubtedly Angola’s
            most famous former prisoner. Under Rideau’s 20-year editorship, the
            magazine won many national awards, but he first made his name as a
            prison reporter with a column he called The Jungle. The very first
            topic he chose was the working of the prison economy.

            Today there are almost 2.3 million prisoners in the US – by far the
            highest number of any country in the world. Louisiana today has the
            second-highest incarceration rate in the US (after Oklahoma overtook
            it in 2018), with a male incarceration rate that far exceeds the
            national average, and Angola is the state’s only maximum-security
            jail. It is also the country’s largest, covering an 18,000-acre site
            that is larger than Manhattan. On a mission to investigate the
            world’s most extreme economies, I set out for Angola. My hunch was
            that I would find examples of simplistic barter; what I discovered
            was an innovative, complex and modern system of hidden trade that
            offers an important lesson about the way economies work.
          </p>
          <p>
            Serving prisoners and ex-convicts say the first law of prison
            economics is unsatisfied demand and the innovation that it
            stimulates. Cut off from the outside, prisoners find themselves
            lacking staples and unable to make choices that they had previously
            taken for granted. The urge to get hold of simple material goods is
            strong, and prisoners I met described the first few weeks inside as
            a shock during which time they learn the rules of their new world
            and adapt to the reality that they have lost not only their freedom
            but also their possessions. Today in Louisiana new inmates receive
            basic supplies: standard-issue clothing, a bar of soap and some
            lotion. But there are lots of day-to-day items they lack and want:
            deodorant, decent jeans, better sneakers. It was the same in the
            1960s, Rideau told me when we met in Baton Rouge, Louisiana’s
            capital: while you got simple provisions, a lot of effort went into
            getting hold of extra comforts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some goods are available via official channels, but getting hold of
            them takes a long time. When a prisoner in Angola orders a book or
            is sent one, it can take six months, or longer, to reach them, since
            censors need to check the content. The delay is an example of a
            general theme in the Louisiana prison economy: it operates in a time
            warp.
          </p>
          <p>
            Time works differently in Louisiana prisons in part because the
            state’s sentences have, historically, been so long. Reforms since
            2017 have begun to make some sentencing guidelines more lenient, but
            for decades everyone convicted of murder in the state got a
            mandatory life sentence, as did any accomplices or friends who were
            at the scene. Even nonviolent crimes have often led to huge
            sentences in Louisiana. Mandatory sentences for repeat offenders
            often doubled with each conviction. There was also, until recently,
            another rule that meant a fourth offence could have a mandatory
            minimum of 20 years and a maximum of life in jail. I met one
            ex-Angola resident, Louis, who spent 20 years in Angola on a drug
            charge. He explained his case isn’t the worst: Timothy Jackson, a
            man caught stealing a jacket from a shop more than 20 years ago, is
            set to spend the rest of his life in Angola. The average sentence in
            Angola is almost 90 years.
          </p>
          <p>
            In many prisons, simple goods that are cheap and insignificant on
            the outside can have huge value inside; in facilities like Angola,
            the ultra-long sentences take this to another level. In his memoir,
            In the Place of Justice, Rideau explains how tiny improvements can
            transform a prisoner’s life. Like the other men on death row, he was
            confined to a small cell. Three of the walls – the back and two
            sides – were brick. The front wall was a grid of bars, offering no
            privacy as guards and other prisoners walked past, and letting in a
            cold draught during winter. Getting hold of a blanket or a curtain
            to hang over the bars could have a transformative effect on an
            inmate’s life. When your world shrinks to a three-sided box, a piece
            of cloth that will grant you privacy and warmth becomes a
            fundamental need you will work hard to satisfy.
          </p>
          <p>
            One way for an inmate to improve his lot in Angola is through
            official work. Another nickname for the penitentiary is “the Farm” –
            it is surrounded by fields planted with crops including corn, wheat,
            sorghum, soybeans and cotton. Inmates toil all year, including in
            August, when temperatures can rise to around 38C. Fruit and
            vegetables are grown and supplied across the state prison system. It
            also raises revenue: Louisiana’s Prison Enterprises, which sells
            goods produced by inmates, brought in almost $29m in 2016, much of
            it from Angola.
          </p>

          <p>
            The prisoners’ official work schedule is designed to take up most of
            their day. Inmates cannot refuse to work, and the vast majority have
            a job of some kind (exceptions include men on death row or in
            solitary confinement). There is a clear hierarchy of jobs, and those
            in the fields are at the bottom. One current prisoner explained to
            me why being sent out “picking greens” is the worst gig in the
            prison: the shift lasts eight hours and it is hot, hard work. The
            men work in parallel lines, tossing waste plant matter to their
            side. Accidentally hitting another prisoner with a discarded stalk
            can cause a fight; cutting your own hand while picking can be taken
            as an attempt at self-harm, leading to a tedious investigation.
            Those who serve a full decade without breaking any rules – fighting
            or self-harm can both set the clock back to zero – are awarded
            “trusty” status. These prisoners get prized jobs such as working as
            a caddy at the guards’ golf club, or as a cleaner at the small
            museum devoted to the history of the penitentiary located just
            outside the main gates.
          </p>
          <p>
            The official payroll at Angola works on a different scale from the
            outside world. For years, inmates say, pay in the penitentiary
            ranged from 2¢ to 20¢ per hour. While recent reforms lift this, most
            of those I spoke to said picking greens or other basic farm work
            would earn just 4¢ per hour, giving them a weekly wage of $1.60. At
            this pay rate a convict must work for 181 hours to earn $7.25, the
            federal minimum hourly wage in the US. Those on the higher rates of
            pay can be quickly demoted. One lifer explained how his trusted
            status was revoked and his pay put to the bottom of the scale when
            he was accused of taking a wrench from the workshop, something he
            said he did not do. Whatever the truth, with good behaviour he can
            expect an annual raise of 4¢ – it could take him several years to
            get back to the higher scale. Work in Angola is hard, mandatory and
            not lucrative.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once cash has been earned, a prisoner can spend it at the
            commissary, of which there are seven in Angola. These official shops
            are a lifeline for prisoners seeking material comforts. In Angola
            they carry Russell Athletic sweatshirts, Fruit of the Loom T-shirts
            and a range of footwear. The other big category is food. The inmates
            are served three meals a day but say they are tasteless; by
            contrast, the commissary offers snacks such as sweet and hot Asian
            sauce, Texas Tito’s jumbo whole dill pickles and jalapeño-flavoured
            cheese curls. The quantities Angola orders reveal the scale of the
            operation: a recent document sets out a tender for 3,000 boxes –
            312,000 packets – of Cool Ranch-flavour Doritos.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prisoners know they are a captive market. The biggest complaints are
            about the prices: prisoners are convinced they are being ripped off,
            paying more than they would in the outside world, and that their
            cost of living is rising faster than their wages. They have a case.
            Until recently, pay scales in Angola have been held at the level
            seen in the 1970s. A packet of rolling tobacco back then retailed at
            less than 50¢, so an inmate on 20¢ could earn a packet in half a
            day. Today it costs around $8 – they would need to work a full week
            to buy a pack.
          </p>
          <p>
            Louisiana is not alone in requiring its prisoners to work on pay
            scales that bear no relation to the cost of goods they might want to
            buy. Legally speaking, prisoners do not need to be paid at all (the
            US constitution’s 13th amendment prohibits all forms of slavery and
            involuntary servitude, “except as punishment for crime”). Prisoners
            in Georgia make furniture and road signs, and receive no payment. In
            Missouri, convicts are paid $7.50 a month for full-time work – an
            hourly rate of around 4¢. The UK’s system is less extreme, but
            similar. Pay rates average around £10 for a 35-hour week, and the
            same price complaints arise: favourite canteen purchases – a bag of
            salted nuts, noodles, breakfast cereal – often sell for over £2.
            Earning one of these items on prison pay can be almost a full day’s
            work.
          </p>
          <p>
            In many ways, a prison’s official economy is like that of a regular
            town. In Angola there is a world of work, with jobs and pay,
            promotions and demotions. And there is a world of shopping, with
            consumer goods and stores. But prisons are economic systems in which
            the cost of goods bears no relation to wages or the buying power of
            the workforce. The most important connections of a market economy –
            the prices that link work and pay, demand and supply – have been
            severed, intentionally, by the authorities. The official prison
            economy exists, but it may as well not, leaving the prisoners to
            build their own underground markets.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the underground prison economy, things that might seem simple are
            hard, and things that might seem impossible can be pretty easy. The
            case of John Goodlow and his pecans illustrates why. For 20 years
            Goodlow was the pecan king of Angola, Wilbert Rideau told me. Pecan
            nuts are grown across the US south, and homemade pecan pralines are
            a favourite treat in Louisiana. Goodlow made his own – the best
            ever, said Rideau, “better than outside” – and sold squares of it
            for $2. He probably could have raised his prices, said Rideau: they
            were so sought after that Goodlow had often pre-sold a whole batch
            before he had even finished cooking it.
          </p>
          <p>
            The fact that making pralines was possible in a maximum-security
            prison is surprising. Cooking them requires lots of ingredients, as
            well as pots, a hotplate and an oven. “Prisoners are never
            powerless,” Rideau said. “They always have the power of rebellion,
            violence, and just screwing up operations and making life hard for
            the management.” The power prisoners have means that management
            often cooperate, and facilitate certain requests, he explained. In
            prisons, on low-level matters, power is shared, and there is room
            for simple tradeoffs. So getting hold of a pan can be fairly easy.
          </p>
          <p>
            But some things that are mundane outside are outlawed in jail.
            Anything that raises the probability of escape or violence is
            banned: weapons, drugs, cigarette lighters, mobile phones. But a
            host of innocent-seeming items are contraband, too: savoury spreads
            like Marmite contain yeast and can be used in illicit brewing;
            chewing gum can be used to make an imprint of a key or lock; baby
            oil can make an inmate’s arms slippery, rendering them impossible to
            restrain.
          </p>
          <p>
            Physical money itself counts as contraband. Instead, prisoners’
            wages are loaded on to cash cards that can be used at the
            commissary. This keeps hard cash out of prisoners’ hands and is a
            way to deprive powerful inmates of resources that could help them
            bribe guards. The logic means cash is treated as top-level
            contraband, and any prisoner with “trusty” status caught handling it
            loses their privileges. The lack of cash is a problem for prisoners
            operating one of the businesses to which guards tend to turn a blind
            eye: baking pecans, selling fried chicken, grooming services ranging
            from haircuts to tattoos to shirt-pressing. These prisoner
            entrepreneurs can offer the goods or service, but cannot accept cash
            as payment. One Angola inmate told me that a prisoner with a
            spotless record for good behaviour would be unlikely to take a $5
            bill as payment, even if the item being sold is worth $2. Money is
            too risky to hold – making US prisons one of the few places on earth
            where the dollar is not accepted. Instead, prisoners are pushed
            towards a barter economy, in which goods are swapped rather than
            bought and sold with money.
          </p>
          <p>
            The problem with barter is that it can be hard to find a swap that
            works. Often the person who wants what you are offering will not own
            the thing you want. Economists have called the rare situation in
            which a swap will work out the “double coincidence of wants”, ever
            since William Stanley Jevons explained the problems with barter, and
            how money solved them, in his 1875 book Money and the Mechanism of
            Exchange. Jevons outlined four separate roles that money can play.
            First, money is a medium of exchange, something that everyone
            accepts and that “lubricates the action of exchange”. Second, it is
            a “measure” – the way that prices are set out today. Third, it is a
            “standard” by which future prices may be set. Finally, it is a way
            to “store” value – it can transport economic value over distances or
            through time. Because lots of things have the properties Jevons set
            out, lots of things can become a circulating currency. When a
            currency emerges in this unofficial way, it often has particular
            physical attributes that make it suitable. Above all, it must be an
            object that can change hands hundreds of times without losing value.
            Consumer goods – clothes, shoes, books – would be no good as
            currency since once they are bought they become second-hand and
            their price drops. Commodities – salt, sugar or grain – are much
            better currencies: second-hand salt is as good as new.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, a commodity tends to make a good currency if it is
            “divisible” – easily chopped up and used in smaller trades. Another
            key criterion is durability. Food commodities that rot or spoil
            would make a poor currency. And finally, ease and cost of transport
            matters. Cotton, which is divisible and durable, may seem like a
            good informal currency, but it is so light that it lacks value in
            small quantities: any meaningful trade would require transporting
            huge sacks of it. Prisons have a rich tradition of inventing
            informal currencies. The most obvious prison currency – always
            saleable and easily divisible – is tobacco. For a century,
            underground trading in Angola ran on it. But in 2015 smoking was
            banned, and tobacco and cigarettes became contraband. Around the
            same time, an aggressive new drug called mojo – a type of synthetic
            cannabis – began to infiltrate the prison, and many men became
            hooked. The underground economy was rocked. Its currency was now
            illegal, yet there was huge demand for this new drug. The
            foundations of the prison economy had shifted: what many men wanted
            changed, as did the way they could pay for it. The response in
            Angola, and across Louisiana’s prisons, was to adapt rapidly,
            inventing a new currency, one that is as high-tech as the designer
            drug it is often used to purchase.
          </p>
          <p>
            On my second trip to Louisiana, I arranged to meet an ex-convict in
            his mid-30s who had recently been released after 16 years in state
            prisons, including Angola. “Most people in prison are looking for
            some kind of way to get high,” he said. “It is a way to kill time.”
            But there is a more specific reason why mojo took off so quickly:
            “It changes so much that it is hard for them to drug test for it.”
            Continual adjustment of the compounds used in synthetic cannabis
            means there are thousands of variants, making detection difficult.
            Louisiana prisoners remember mojo first appearing in 2010 or 2011.
            One ex-convict I met in New Orleans remembered the rumours:
            “Everyone was like: ‘You can smoke it and pass the drugs test.’ But
            in my mind I was like: ‘They test you for THC, so if it is not THC
            that is getting you high, what is getting you high?’” It was a wise
            decision to be cautious, he recalled: “I said no, but they all
            started smoking it. Some started having seizures and aneurysms, and
            people were freaking out and getting paranoid and scared. I saw a
            dude get butt-naked and jump in a dumpster and refuse to come out.
            They were going crazy on it. But they loved it.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The first rule of prison economics is unsatisfied demand, and on
            this measure mojo had become king in Louisiana’s prisons. The demand
            was huge. Once the drug had been smuggled in, the only challenge
            that remained was how to pay the smugglers. The informal currencies
            used inside the prison are often of no real use outside, so
            prisoners running serious hustles like mojo smuggling don’t use them
            – the way to persuade guards to smuggle contraband in is with cash.
            The use of dollars inside the prison is a puzzle. Anyone running a
            major drug operation is going to need to shift large cash balances,
            but dollar bills are something sniffer dogs can detect, and any
            digital transfers can be traced. It turns out that drug traders and
            smugglers face none of these risks, because Louisiana prisons have a
